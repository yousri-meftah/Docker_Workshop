# Docker Playground Basics

This mini-module introduces Docker concepts.

Sequence:
1. Images (pull, list, inspect)
2. Containers (run, list, logs, exec)
3. Volumes (persist data)
4. Networks (container-to-container)
5. Dockerfile (build your own image)
6. Cleanup

Prereqs:
- Docker installed
- `docker` command works for your user (no sudo)

Tip: If you are unsure, run this first:
```bash
docker --version
```

Next: go to `01_images.md`.
